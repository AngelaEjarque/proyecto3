             <p>The mastermind game consist in guess the right combination of colors including the right position, before the rounds end. </br>
                The same color can be in more than one celd, be careful!.</br>
                The player has to enter the combination he thinks is correct. </br>
                To do that, the player has to click on the colour and click on the celd from bottom to top in every row depending on what round is.</br>
                Then, press the "check" button.</br>
                There are some circles at the right of the screen, that represents if you're right or not.</br></br>
                Purple means is the right color in right position.</br>
                White means right color in wrong position.</br>
                If there is no color, means the color is not in the winning combination.
